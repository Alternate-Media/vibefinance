# 🛠️ Services Context

## Purpose
This directory contains the business logic and 3rd-party library wrappers (Dependency Quarantine).

## 📜 Strict Rules
1. **Dependency Quarantine:** Never import 3rd-party libraries (like `cryptography` or external APIs) directly into models or routes. Use these service wrappers instead.
2. **Statelessness:** Services should be stateless where possible, relying on Dependency Injection for configuration or database sessions.
3. **ALE Enforcement:** The `EncryptionService` is the ONLY place where raw encryption keys or logic should exist.

## 🏗️ Key Services
- **EncryptionService:** Handles ALE for sensitive database fields.
